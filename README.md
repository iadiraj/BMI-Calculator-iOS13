#  BMI Calculator

## Goal

The goal of this project is to learn more about Optionals, solidify my understanding of the MVC design pattern, and introduce the concept of Classes. I’ll compare objects created from classes with instances of Structs that I learned about earlier. 

## What I have created

By the end of the project, I would have made a Body Mass Index calculator. Based on the user’s weight and height it will calculate their body mass and give a piece of health advice depending on whether they have eaten too many pies or if they need to eat more pies. 

## What I have learned

* How to create multi-screen apps with animated navigation.
* Optional binding, optional chaining, and the nil coalescing operator.
* How to create classes and differences between classes and structs. 
* Pass by value vs. pass by reference. 
* Formatting Strings. 
* Color literals.
